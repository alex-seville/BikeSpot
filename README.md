##Project Description

Our project is an app to help cyclists find safe, reliable bike parking/bike racks.  Users can find racks near their destination, view the rack details, provide feedback on racks they've used, and even contribute by adding a description and photo of a location themselves.



Benchmark Apps:

Estately, Trulia, Zillow: For map interactions, detail views, map searching

AirBnb: For visual effect
